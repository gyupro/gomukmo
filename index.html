        <h2>Introduction to Consonants</h2>
        <p>Consonants are sounds that are produced with an obstruction by the speech organs. For example, the consonant 'ㅅ' is produced by the friction of air passing between the tip of the tongue and the upper gums.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Classification of Consonants</h2>
        <p>Consonants can be classified based on their articulation location, manner of articulation, and the intensity of the sound.</p>
        <p>The classification table for consonants may feel more complex than that for vowels, primarily due to unfamiliar terms.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Types of Consonants</h2>
        <p>Initially, consonants are divided into sounds with vocal cord vibration (voiced) and without (voiceless). For example, the voiced sound 'ㅁ' and the voiceless sound 'ㄱ' in the syllable finals of '금' (geum) and '극' (geuk) show a noticeable difference in vibration.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Voiced sounds (유성음): Produced with vibration of the vocal cords.</li>
            <li>Voiceless sounds (무성음): Produced without vibration of the vocal cords.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Manner of Articulation</h2>
        <p>Consonants are further classified by the method of sound production:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stops: Blocking the airflow and then releasing it (e.g., ㅂ, ㅍ, ㄷ, ㅌ, ㄱ, ㅋ).</li>
            <li>Fricatives: Producing sound by forcing air through a narrow space (e.g., ㅅ, ㅆ, ㅎ).</li>
            <li>Affricates: Combining the properties of stops and fricatives (e.g., ㅈ, ㅉ, ㅊ).</li>
            <li>Nasals: Sound produced by blocking the oral cavity and using the nose (e.g., ㅇ, ㄴ, ㅁ).</li>
            <li>Liquids: Lightly touching the articulators and then releasing (e.g., ㄹ).</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Intensity of Sounds</h2>
        <p>Consonants are also categorized by their sound intensity:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Plain sounds (평음): e.g., ㄱ, ㄷ, ㅂ, ㅅ, ㅈ.</li>
            <li>Tense sounds (경음): e.g., ㄲ, ㄸ, ㅃ, ㅆ, ㅉ.</li>
            <li>Aspirated sounds (유기음, 격음): e.g., ㅋ, ㅌ, ㅍ, ㅊ.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Articulation Locations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Bilabial (양순음, 두입술): Sounds made between the lips (e.g., ㅂ, ㅃ, ㅍ, ㅁ).</li>
            <li>Alveolar (설단음, 치조음, 치경음): Sounds made between the tip of the tongue and the gums (e.g., ㄷ, ㄸ, ㅌ, ㅅ, ㅆ, ㄴ, ㄹ).</li>
            <li>Palatal (경구개음): Sounds made between the tip of the tongue and the hard palate (e.g., ㅈ, ㅉ, ㅊ).</li>
            <li>Velar (연구개음): Sounds made with the back of the tongue against the soft palate (e.g., ㄱ, ㄲ, ㅋ, ㅇ).</li>
            <li>Glottal (후음): Sounds produced in the throat (e.g., ㅎ).</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <p>Understanding these concepts of consonants may seem daunting at first, but with repeated exposure, they become more accessible and understandable.</p>
